# Author's Kit: Final Paper Template (TeX Source)

Welcome to the collaborative template for ACS - Assignment 2a: Author Instructions. This template is designed to be flexible, so feel free to adapt the sections to best suit your paper's needs.

## Getting Started: Local TeX Setup

To compile this template locally, you'll need a TeX engine with `bibtex`/`biber` support. Here's a straightforward guide for setting up VS Code with TeX Live, `pdflatex`, and `bibtex`:

### Step 1: Install TeX Live

Download and install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for your operating system.

### Step 2: Verify Build Tools

Ensure that `pdflatex` and `bibtex` are installed with your TeX Live distribution. You can verify their installation by checking if they're available as commands in your terminal.

### Step 3: Configure VS Code

1. Open VS Code
1. Select "Open Workspace from file..."
1. Navigate to and select `cse3000.code-workspace` from your repository root

This workspace configuration includes custom settings that will automatically generate PDF files when you save your work.

### Step 4: Install LaTeX Workshop

VS Code will prompt you to install the LaTeX Workshop extension, or you can find it under Extensions/Recommended. This extension is essential for the TeX compilation workflow.

### Step 5: Start Writing

Once everything is set up, simply save your `main.tex` file, and a new PDF will be generated automatically in the `doc` folder.

Now you're ready to begin writing your paper! Let me know if you need any clarification or run into issues during setup.
