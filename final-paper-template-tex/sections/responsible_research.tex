\section{Responsible Research}
Here you should critically reflect on the ethical aspects of your research and discuss the reproducibility of your methods. Note that although in many published works there is no such a section (it may be part of some meta-information collected by the journal, or part of the discussion section), we require you to think and report about this in your final paper.
