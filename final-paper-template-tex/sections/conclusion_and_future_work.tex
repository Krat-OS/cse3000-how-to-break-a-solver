\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
There are multiple goals which should be satisfied in this section. Briefly summarize the main research question(s) and provide your conclusions, the answers to the research question(s). Highlight interesting elements, contributions. Discuss open issues, possible improvements, and new questions that arise from this work; formulate recommendations for further research (for instance suggest new lines of research).

This section should stand on its own: it should be readable without having read the earlier sections and be understandable for anyone with a BSc degree in Computer Science.
