\section{Discussion}
In this section results are compared to those of previous work and placed in a broader context. You also provide a reflection on what has been concluded and how this was done. Finally, you attempt to give a possible explanation of results.

Again, you may opt to give this section another name, or even combine it with the preceding or following section.
