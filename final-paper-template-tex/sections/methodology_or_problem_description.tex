\section{Methodology or Problem Description}
Choose an approach that fits your research best:
\subsection{Methodology}
Typically in general research articles, the second section contains a description of the research methodology explaining what you -- the researcher -- is doing to answer the research question(s), and why you have chosen this method. For purely analytical work this is a description of the data collection process or experimental setup for testing the hypothesis with a motivation.
In any case this section includes references to necessary background information. For a survey paper this includes the method of how you collected the the set of papers that are considered in your survey.

\subsection{Formal Problem Description}
For some types of work in computer science the methodology is standard: analyze the problem (e.g., make assumptions and derive properties), present a new algorithm and its theoretical background, proving its correctness, and evaluate unproven aspects in simulation. An explanation of the methodology is often omitted and the setup of the evaluation is part of a later section on the evaluation of the ideas\footnote{There really is no single outline that works for all papers.}. In such case, you should explain relevant background concepts, theory and models in this section (with references) and relate them to your research question. Also this section then typically contains a more precise, formal description of the problem.

Do not forget to give this section another name, for example, relating to the problem which you are solving.
