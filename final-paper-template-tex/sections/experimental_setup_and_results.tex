\section{Experimental Setup and Results}
As discussed earlier, in many sciences the methodology is explained in Section 2 and this section only discusses the results. 
However, in computer science, most often the details (for instance the simulation environment) of the evaluation setup are for the first time described here. It is of critical importance that a skilled reader should be able to reproduce your setup and obtain the same results.

Then, you should report your results in an accessible manner using figures and tables (with captions that allow them to be understood without going through the whole text). You should also make observations that clearly follow from the presented results. You can also report conclusions that follow logically from the previous material -- sometimes the conclusions are in fact hypotheses which in turn may give rise to new experiments to be validated in this or future works.

Again, you may want to give this section another name.
